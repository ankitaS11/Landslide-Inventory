As a result, four houses were damaged due to the debris flow. However, many small-scale landslips were also recorded in the area. The slide (Lat: 11°19\\'14.94\"N and Lon: 76°37\\'31.34\"E) is a complex slide, which initiated as a cut slope failure and the subsequently leading to the earth flow. Ground cracks ranging from 5-10 cm were observed in the close vicinity of the slide, which also indicates chances of future reactivation, if untreated. Ground subsidence of about 1 m was observed in the slide zone. ',\n",

Talacauvery, the place from where Cauvery River originates is an important pilgrim and tourist centre. The area is situated 43.5 km east of Madikeri town. It is a reactivated slide and it was first initiated during the year 2007. The present slide got reactivated on 06th August, 2020 due to intense rainfall covering part of the old slide zone (2007). It can be inferred that the Talacauvery landslide underwent four episodes of events i.e. on the year 2007, 2018, 2019 and 2020. ',\n",

The landslide occurred at the eastern flank (hill slope of 45° toward 130° at sliding zone) of NNE-SSW trending hill ridge. Cracks in the concrete house, the paved drain and the approached road are observed. It caused subsidence of 40 cm in the crown portion of the slide and 60 cm in the highway. Five number of houses were partially damaged due to this slide. The Khumji Noney Slide (Lat: 24°5’45.7”N and Lon: 93°37’26.6”E) occurred about 100 meters from Noney bazaar towards Jiribam on the NH-37, Imphal-Jiribam road. The area is represented by highly dissected, rugged, NNE-SSW trending alternate synclinal hill ridges and anticlinal valleys showing a 2nd order topography. Excessive cutting of the slope for construction of waiting shed and water seepage in the upslope portion are the geo-scientific causes. \\r\\n',\n",

The present landslide affected area is part of the old-landslide zone, with thick unconsolidated/ semi consolidated debris above the in-situ bedrock. The landslide affected area has a very poor surface drainage management. During heavy rainfall during the month of June and July 2020, water flows over the road and remain stagnant within the depressions caused due to heavy vehicle movement with stagnant water along the road side-line concrete drainage. The transient downward water percolation on the road, steep and moderate steep slope, where the surface material is old-landslide debris has lead to the over-saturation of the underlying material.\\r\\n',\n",

As a result of the landslide, a house was totally damaged and 4 persons of a family buried and causes loss of property. The main causative factor is the continuous heavy rainfall resulting in subsurface percolation of rainwater and the build-up of undesirable pore pressure in overburden material. Anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation and high angle slope cutting, is also considered to be a causative factor.',\n",

The landslide (Lat: 27⁰ 04\\'52.7\"N and Lon: 93⁰ 36\\' 46.2\"E) is initiated due to the outward and downward movement of unstable slope material resulting into loss of life (a two-year-old child) and property. The main causative factor is attributed to the incessant heavy rainfall over the last few days which oversaturated the unconsolidated slope forming material of the Quaternary Period composed mostly of sand, silt and clay. Infiltration of the rainwater resulted in the development of pore water pressure and reduced shear strength parameters of the slope forming material, thereby causing the slope failure. Moreover, anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation and unplanned house and road construction practice also contributed to the slope instability. ',\n",

The primary triggering factor of the documented landslides is heavy antecedent rainfall which increased surface runoff beyond the drainage capacity of existing drainage system in the affected areas.

The coordinates of the Dhare landslide (Lat: 27° 23′ 55.2″N and Lon: 88° 37′ 24.9″E) and Sitala landslide (Lat: 27° 23′ 54.2″N and Lon: 88° 37′ 32.4″E) and falls in SOI Toposheet No.  78A/11. At both the landslide locations, it has been observed that the area mainly comprises of unconsolidated soil and debris material. No in-situ rock was observed in and around the area. These two landslides are located in close proximity of a NE-SW trending Regional Fault which is the major cause of concern. Excessive water saturation due to improper irrigation practice (Cardamom) cultivation reduces shear strength parameters of slope forming materials and makes slope prone to failure. Toe erosion by unplanned cutting of road section, as observed at both Dharey and Satala area, may also result in slope failure.',\n",

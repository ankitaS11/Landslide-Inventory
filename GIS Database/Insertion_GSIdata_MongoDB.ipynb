The landslide affected area has a very poor surface drainage management. During heavy rainfall during the month of June and July 2020, water flows over the road and remain stagnant within the depressions caused due to heavy vehicle movement with stagnant water along the road side-line concrete drainage. The transient downward water percolation on the road, steep and moderate steep slope, where the surface material is old-landslide debris has lead to the over-saturation of the underlying material.\\r\\n',\n",

The landslide (Lat: 27⁰ 04\\'52.7\"N and Lon: 93⁰ 36\\' 46.2\"E) is initiated due to the outward and downward movement of unstable slope material resulting into loss of life (a two-year-old child) and property. The main causative factor is attributed to the incessant heavy rainfall over the last few days which oversaturated the unconsolidated slope forming material of the Quaternary Period composed mostly of sand, silt and clay. Infiltration of the rainwater resulted in the development of pore water pressure and reduced shear strength parameters of the slope forming material, thereby causing the slope failure. Moreover, anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation and unplanned house and road construction practice also contributed to the slope instability. ',\n",

A central team led by GSI visited the affected site from 13 to 15 June 2017. Blocking of the river course, damming, consequent ingression of the water in the down/ slide slope and rapid toe cutting form the high velocity released water might have triggered the initiation of the failure and movement of material downslope. The heavy rainfall prior to 4 June 2017 and sudden release of water from the temporary dam accelerated further saturation, rapid toe erosion and dragging of the upslope mass and formation of large gaping cracks.\",\n",

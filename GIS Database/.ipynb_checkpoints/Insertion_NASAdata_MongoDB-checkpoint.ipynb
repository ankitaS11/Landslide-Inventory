It took the PWD over five hours to clear the road with the help of excavators. Deputy commissioner Chandregowda visited the spot with PWD engineers.   Since many landslides have been occurring at many spots along the Mangalore road, the deputy commissioner has instructed officials to deploy an excavator on the Mangalore road to remove road blocks whenever and wherever required. There are also many instances of roads being blocked by fallen trees and landslides of smaller intensities, in the interior parts of the district.  ',\n",

Both landslides took place in the Borghat section of the E-way, one near Adoshi tunnel on Monday and other near Khandala on Tuesday. Since they were not major landslides, nobody was injured but a lane of the road was blocked. MSRDC officials said Monday’s landslide took place between km numbers 39 and 42 on the Pune-Mumbai corridor, while Tuesday’s landslide was between km numbers 36 and 39 on the Mumbai-Pune corridor.

He said the suspension of the yatra left over 60,000 pilgrims stranded at various base camps including Baltal, Sheshnag, Pajtarni and Nunwan. \"The yatra will be resumed only after the track is cleared of the landslides and declared safe for trekking,\" the official said.  He said a massive landslide blocked the track between Railpathri and Baltal on the shorter 13-km route, preferred by large number of pilgrims compared to the traditional 46-km Pahalgam route.

The Border Roads Organization (BRO) later managed to resume normal vehicular services.  At St Mary's Hills, further rain hampered rescue operations.

Continuing heavy showers have caused landslides and led to the sinking of a portion of NH 39, creating immense hardship to the people residing here. NH 39, the lifeline of the two northeastern states, connects Manipur with Assam via Nagaland.  If the monsoon showers continue with the same intensity, it is expected that the sunken portion of the highway will have to be closed as it has already become difficult for vehicles to pass through the place.  The main concern of the administrative authorities is the landslide area at the old Kohima Municipal Council (KMC) dumping site about 7 km away from the state capital where mudslides have started with the arrival of the monsoon, leading to disruption of vehicular traffic. Passengers travelling between Kohima and Dimapur have also complained that it is already taking hours to reach their destination.  ',\n",

For few hours the mud was cleared and the road was made thorough but the continuous rain is creating hurdles in restoration works,\" BRO official P K Gupta informed. The Alubari Ghat connecting Tezu with Namsai had also been closed owing to surging waters of the Lohit river and its tributaries, sources said. ',\n",

A part of the road was cleared by 1pm.  Residents of Sevoke, 20km from here, said the hillside came tumbling down on NH31A that also connects Kalimpong around 4am. Although no houses were damaged, the debris covering about 30 metres of the highway — from Coronation Bridge to the Sevoke police outpost — stopped traffic till the highway was partly cleared.  This is the first major landslide in the hills after Cyclone Aila struck on May 26. At that time there were 40 landslides, which killed 28 people. ',\n",

Water absorption capacity of land has reached its peak level and soil is flowing downwards, making transportation dangerous and bringing loss to farmers.  It usually happens in monsoon that plenty of rain triggers landslides in hill state but the rain and snowfall has created the same environment in winters. The terraced fields of Kullu are collapsing gradually and apple trees are getting uprooted. Landslides between Kullu and Manali have made road transportation dangerous. Debris and boulders are constantly falling everywhere on the highway.  Continuous landslides at Raison, Dobhi, Alu Ground, Rangri and Manali are disturbing vehicular traffic. For travelers, it is a big risk to travel between Kullu and Manali as they cannot guess that when and from where a massive rock would fall on them.

Most interior villagers of Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire are cut out from the rest of the state. With good roads beyond their dreams even on dry days, rainy days are a nightmare for the people. Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before. The use of roads by all size vehicles has spoilt most of the soiled roads making it difficult for smaller vehicles to ply. ',\n",

       "    'Description': 'Dimapur| July 12  : Yet another monsoon season in Nagaland and one has to batter bad roads.    This year’s monsoon has been the worse by far.  Most interior villagers of Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire are cut out from the rest of the state. With good roads beyond their dreams even on dry days, rainy days are a nightmare for the people. Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before. The use of roads by all size vehicles has spoilt most of the soiled roads making it difficult for smaller vehicles to ply. ',\n",

In a memorandum submitted to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, chief minister Oommen Chandy said monsoon-related calamities were to be considered a national disaster and the state -- which had been fighting the ill- effects of severe drought till a couple of months ago -- was not in a position to handle the financial implications of rain devastation in Kerala. Monsoon rainfall in 2013 had exceeded the forecast, causing landslides and floods in several districts. Coastal erosion compounded the problem, damaging the state coastline significantly. Floods devastated several villages leading to evacuation and dislocation of a large number of families, the memorandum said. \"Out of the 1,51,652km of roads in the state, more than 50% have been severely damaged.

These widespread, composite flows in the over saturated slope forming materials caused 182 deaths including that of 3 foreign tourists, damaged 607 houses, breached all major communication networks to Leh town besides inflicting an unaccountable loss of livestock and agriculture fields. The disaster caused severe damage to the settlements in parts of Leh town, Sabu village, Choklamsar, Leh airport area, Nimu, Ney and Bazgo area around the town. Widespread occurrence of varied, unconsolidated Quaternary drift deposits perched over gentle to fairly steep slopes are susceptible to mass movement under conditions of heavy saturation.

       "     'Description': 'Heavy downpour in the past few days threatens to cut off Nagaland and neighbouring Manipur from the rest of the country. Continuing heavy showers have caused landslides and led to the sinking of a portion of NH 39, creating immense hardship to the people residing here. NH 39, the lifeline of the two northeastern states, connects Manipur with Assam via Nagaland.  If the monsoon showers continue with the same intensity, it is expected that the sunken portion of the highway will have to be closed as it has already become difficult for vehicles to pass through the place.  The main concern of the administrative authorities is the landslide area at the old Kohima Municipal Council (KMC) dumping site about 7 km away from the state capital where mudslides have started with the arrival of the monsoon, leading to disruption of vehicular traffic. Passengers travelling between Kohima and Dimapur have also complained that it is already taking hours to reach their destination.  ',\n",

As a result, at least 12 trains either had to be short-terminated or cancelled over the last 24 hours.

The blockade prompted the railway authorities to short-terminate Jagdalpur-Bhubaneswar-Hirakhand Express. It was short terminated at Koraput on Tuesday and cancelled between Koraput and Bhubaneswar while the Bhubaneswar-Jagdalpur-Hirakhand Express was short terminated at Rayagada.

Water absorption capacity of land has reached its peak level and soil is flowing downwards, making transportation dangerous and bringing loss to farmers.  It usually happens in monsoon that plenty of rain triggers landslides in hill state but the rain and snowfall has created the same environment in winters. The terraced fields of Kullu are collapsing gradually and apple trees are getting uprooted. Landslides between Kullu and Manali have made road transportation dangerous. Debris and boulders are constantly falling everywhere on the highway.  Continuous landslides at Raison, Dobhi, Alu Ground, Rangri and Manali are disturbing vehicular traffic. For travelers, it is a big risk to travel between Kullu and Manali as they cannot guess that when and from where a massive rock would fall on them.

Most interior villagers of Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire are cut out from the rest of the state. With good roads beyond their dreams even on dry days, rainy days are a nightmare for the people. Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before.

State disaster management official Amir Ali said rescuers were searching for two other men missing since the avalanche struck Monday night near the remote mountain town of Gurez. It is on India's side of the militarized cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. Avalanches and landslides are common in Kashmir thanks to heavy snowfall and frequent rain. Meanwhile, low atmospheric pressure over the region Monday night caused unusually strong winds, gusting up to 27 miles (44 kilometers) per hour through the main city of Srinagar.\",\n",

A two-wheeler was also buried under the debris following a landslide at Gawasawaddo. According to reports, the landslide brought down the two trees onto the houses belonging to Jayant Chari and Ramnath Chari, while the two-wheeler belonging to Soniya Naik was buried under the debris. Upon receiving the information, former councillor Deepak Mhadoshri rushed to the site and informed the Mapusa Municipal Council and Mapusa fire officials. The fire fighters inspected the landslide area and the operation to clear the trees will be carried out on Wednesday.

Most interior villagers of Mon, Tuensang and Kiphire are cut out from the rest of the state. With good roads beyond their dreams even on dry days, rainy days are a nightmare for the people. Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before. The use of roads by all size vehicles has spoilt most of the soiled roads making it difficult for smaller vehicles to ply. ',\n",

It also suggested to the government to appoint a committee to inquire into the incident at Sociedade Fomento's beneficiation plant.  Mining department submitted the report on the mishap in which three persons were buried alive after a 'tailing stack' of the mine collapsed at Cuddegal on June 18.  According to the report, heavy rains triggered the collapse of the mining dump and tailing point at the beneficiation plant.  'For the last four days there were heavy rains. Around 7 to 8 inches of rain was recorded in Goa in those days, this may be one of the causes for the mining dump to crash,' stated the report. \",\n",

Monsoon rainfall in 2013 had exceeded the forecast, causing landslides and floods in several districts. Coastal erosion compounded the problem, damaging the state coastline significantly.

The present landslide affected area is part of the old-landslide zone, with thick unconsolidated/ semi consolidated debris above the in-situ bedrock. The landslide affected area has a very poor surface drainage management.

A landslide occurred at Donyi Colony, Itanagar, Papumpare district, Arunachal Pradesh, at around 8:12 am on 25.06.2020. The landslide (Lat: 27⁰ 04'52.7""N and Lon: 93⁰ 36' 46.2""E) is initiated due to the outward and downward movement of unstable slope material resulting into loss of life (a two-year-old child) and property. The main causative factor is attributed to the incessant heavy rainfall over the last few days which oversaturated the unconsolidated slope forming material of the Quaternary Period composed mostly of sand, silt and clay. Infiltration of the rainwater resulted in the development of pore water pressure and reduced shear strength parameters of the slope forming material, thereby causing the slope failure. Moreover, anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation and unplanned house and road construction practice also contributed to the slope instability. ",25-06-2020,.,0,0,

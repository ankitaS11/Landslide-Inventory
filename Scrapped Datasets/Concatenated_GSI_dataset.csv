ii. As per local source from the Chairman, Song-Song Village, there was a culvert that
drained the road side-line drainage to the slope on the eastern side of the NH-2 that was
sealed with concrete lining after the 2006 landslide.
iii. The building on the eastern side of the NH-2 has history of slight subsidence over the
past few years. The sudden subsidence with throw of about 1.5ft along the road (Photo 1 and
2) and developed pronounced cracks within concrete structure and widening of the cracks
between the road and structure (Photo 3) is reported during the month of June and July,
2020.
iv. The road side line covered concrete drainage (opposite western side of the landslide
crown) is not properly functional with stagnant water.
v. Concrete drainages were constructed to drain sewage water. At present, due to the
development of tensional cracks and subsequent subsidence of the eastern portion of the road
and parts of settlement areas. The surface water run-off is drained towards the eastern part
and water percolation is observed along the tensional cracks developed within the drainage
(Photo 4).
vi. The Assam type residential houses located at approximately between 15 to 40m below
the road bench shows back tilting (towards the crown road side) (Fig.3 and Photo 8) with
pronounced subsidence and cracks on the cemented floor of the houses and retaining wall.
The seepage of water from the ground has led to the accumulation of water inside the house
(Photo 9).

vii. The cracks developed at the crown portion have been sealed very recently. However
new minor cracks measuring around 0.5 to 1 cm wide are seen developing in the adjoining
areas of the already sealed part (Photo 5). At the present scenario, during the rains water
flows over the road (including the already sealed portion of the road and its adjoining areas)
and percolates downward through the newly developed cracks. ","Regionally, the area is represented by highly dissected, rugged, NNE-SSW trending
alternate synclinal hill ridges and anticlinal valleys showing a 2nd order topography. In the
disturbed area, the portion of the hill slope located towards the east of NH-2 shows three
prominent topographic break-in-slope i.e., very steep slope just below the road (60-70°),
moderate mid-slope break (30-35°) and steep slope towards the further north (35 to 60°)
joining the northeasterly flowing Pije River (Fig 4 ). ","(So/J1: 310°/23°SW, J2: 210°/70°SE and J3: 300°/70°NE). Eastern
limb of the anticline. J3 joint plane and slope dips in the same direction
within the sandstone above the NH-2. ",The landuse pattern on either side of the road is mostly used for commercial buildings with few residential houses. The eastern part immediately below the NH-2 where landslide has affected is mostly residential Assam type houses. The mid-slope break is mostly use for terrace agricultural farming by the natives. The gentle slope on the right flanks of the landslide is used for terrace paddy field agricultural use with moderately thick vegetation cover. The left flank is mostly covered with moderate vegetation cover (Fig 3).,"The study area around Mao (Song Song village) is drained by the Pije river, which
originates from the higher ridges above the TB hospital and Mao potato farm and drains
northeasterly. Small seasonal streams and gullies drains the excess surface water run-off
below the NH-2 flows northerly and joins the Pije River.
The NH-2 hillside lined concrete drainage opposite to the landslide crown is not
functioning properly as evident by the presence of stagnant water. The transient downward
percolation of water along the tensional cracks developed on the road and drainage is
observed. The heavy water seepage and water pooling is observed within the Assam type
residential houses which are back tilted 10-20° (Photo 9). At many places water seepage is
observed at the steep slope break (Photo 10). The irrigational water culvert drains (at places
open canal drain) across the body of the landslide and a small water pond being made at the
mid-slope along the strike of the landslide movement (Fig 3)",Rainfall ,Nil ,Commercial and Residential houses ,Nil ,"NH-2, Residential houses, Commercial concrete buildings Commercial

vegetation cover along the flanks of the slope",,"The Mao landslide occurred along the road section of NH-2, causing subsidence of the
road posing immense threat to the vital road corridor and affecting the residential and
commercial buildings. Recurring landslide along the east facing taxi stand and SDO office
block is confirmed based on temporal Google-earth satellite images since 2006 to present. The
subsidence along the road with pronounced cracks and displacement within concrete structure
and widening of the cracks between the road and structure is reported during the month of June
and July, 2020.
The predisposing factors for the present landslide includes inherent geological contact
zone between the Disang (shale dominant) and Barial (sandstone dominant) group of rock,
which are highly jointed in nature. The topography of the area shows three prominent
topographic breaks in slope gradient and the mid-slope shows the old-landslide zone filled with
unconsolidated/semi-consolidated debris. The existing drainage system arrangement in the
landslide affected zone is not well maintained to drain the surface run-off. The construction of
heavy concrete commercial/residential structure on the steep road side may also have cause
static loading on the edge and construction of houses within the unconsolidated old-landslide
debris seems to be the major predisposing factor. The extensive transient water seepage along
the tensional cracks and penetrative rock planar fabric at the crown area and excess surface
water run-off seepage within the debris into the underlying the less consolidated debris of oldlandslide may have aggravate development of local hydrostatic pore pressure. Incessant rain
during the month of June and July, 2020 may have triggered land subsidence. ",II,17.07.2020,,,

highly weathered intercalated sequence of siltstone and clay belonging

saturation by antecedent heavy rainfall and incision by drainages and
erosion condition on the slope led to downward movement of slope
forming material. Though the affected slope face could not be assessed
properly due to rainfall and thick slurry of slide material on the valley

highly weathered siltstone and soil cover rested on an unfavorable
moderate steep angle valley dipping bedding plane and failed along the

landslide with a dimension of about 25m in width and 20m in length was
triggered by incessant heavy rains. The loose and thick (>5m) nature of the
overburden (soil and highly weathered rock) without any toe support on
saturation by the incessant rainfall resulted in failure. The concavity of the
slope helped in retention of water within the unconsolidated material which
on crossing the inherent stability limit, slid downslope. In addition, the

Infiltration of the rainwater resulted in the development of pore water pressure and reduced shear strength parameters of the slope forming material, thereby causing the slope failure.
